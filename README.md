## Overview

CertiCoq is a compiler for Gallina, the specification language of the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/index.html). CertiCoq targets Clight, a subset of the C language that can be compiled with any C compiler, including the [CompCert](http://compcert.org) verified compiler.

The goal of the CertiCoq project is to build an end-to-end verified compiler for Gallina, bridging the gap between formally verified source programs and their compiled executables.  

Large parts of the CertiCoq compiler have been verified whereas others are in the process of being verified.

You can find CertiCoq's souce code on [GitHub](https://github.com/CertiCoq/certicoq). CertiCoq is part of the [DeepSpec](https://deepspec.org) project.

## Documentation

The [CertiCoq Wiki](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/certicoq/wiki) has instructions for using the [CertiCoq plugin](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/certicoq/wiki/The-CertiCoq-plugin) to compile Gallina to C and interfacing with the generated C code.

The Wiki also gives an [overview](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/certicoq/wiki/The-CertiCoq-pipeline) of the compiler and its verification status.
